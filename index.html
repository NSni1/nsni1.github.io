						What is <b>Cyber Security</b>?
					</h1>
				</div>
				<p class="oxuglwr">
					<b>Computer security</b>, <b>cybersecurity (cyber security)</b>, or <b>information technology security (IT security)</b> is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of, or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

						<h3 class="oxuglwr">Financial Systems</h3>
						<p class="oxuglwr">The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SWIFT, investment banks, and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains. Websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers, brokerage accounts, and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the black market.</p>

						<h3 class="oxuglwr">Aviation</h3>
						<p class="oxuglwr">The aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked. A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide, much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted, and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore. There is also potential for attack from within an aircraft.</p>

					<div id="vg">
						<h3 class="oxuglwr">Government</h3>
						<p class="oxuglwr">Government and military computer systems are commonly attacked by activists and foreign powers. Local and regional government infrastructure such as traffic light controls, police and intelligence agency communications, personel records, student records, and financial systems are also potential targets as they are now all largely computerized. Passports and government ID cards that control access to facilities which use RFID can be vulnerable to cloning.</p>
